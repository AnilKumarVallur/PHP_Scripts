1. Login to your gmail account
2. Go to google translate home page (https://translate.google.com)
3. Click on translate website option below
4. Fill in the required details
5. Copy and paste the code in the web pages you want to be translated

NOTE: You need to choose website default language also in the options of translate. This will help you to translate to the default
language after you tranlate. Example below for this condition.

Example: My website originally written for English readers. I wanted to tranlate it to Kannada and Hindi so I chose only Kannada and Hindi 
in the translate language options. I was able to convert it to Hindi/Kannada but I wasn't able to revert back to English, this
situation told me to choose English also in the translate language options.
