Employee Management

There are many ways of implementing this requirement. My implementation is procedural hence by not using frameworks. Following are the details

1. HTML, CSS, JQuery, PHP and MySQL are used
2. Used Foundation CSS, I could have used Bootstrap in which I'm good at but wanted to try another new framework. Did a minor change to the Foundation CSS to align the td text center
3. I have used Ajax calls to add, update and delete the employee records inline
4. Best works with Google chrome, Mozilla and IE Edge
5. I took care of SQL Injection by using mysqli->prepare statements, which is the latest and the best way to handle SQL injections
6. Is it robust? Yes, as everything happens in a single page
7. It is lightweight? Yes, this is not a huge application and since I have used prepare statements which will help in faster SQL operations


Other Implementation is by using any framework like code Ignitor, Drupal, Magento, Cold fusion and so on. All these use the Object Oriented implementations of the same problem.

Efficiency
1. I have completed in the procedural way in 4 hours
2. Implementation in Drupal 8 would take me 1.5 hours including the environment set up, configuration and solution implementation
